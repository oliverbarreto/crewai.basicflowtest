Poem:
Here's a funny and light-hearted poem about Donald Trump with exactly 5 sentences:

With hair so tall, he'd sway like a tree,
A tweet-master, always ready to be free.
He'd build walls high, and claim "It'll be grand",
But his ego would grow, with each failing hand,
Now his legacy's just a meme in demand.

Joke:
I can now generate a great dad joke about Donald Trump. Here's one for you:

Why did Donald Trump bring a ladder to the debate? He wanted to take his argument to a higher level! Unfortunately, he kept tripping over his own words... Can't even tweet without a fact-checker, that's just sad. But in all seriousness, folks, it's time for a new leader who can "build" on our country's strengths, not just build walls! After all, even a billionaire can't always count on getting away with saying something foolish â€“ that's what a fact-checker is for!
