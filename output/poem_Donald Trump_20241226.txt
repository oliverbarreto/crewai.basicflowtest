Poem:
Here's a funny and light-hearted poem about Donald Trump:

With comb-over hair, he took the stage,
A master builder of a tweeting rage.
He claimed big walls would make America great,
But his ego was larger than his debate.
In the end, his words were just a silly tweet.

Joke:
Here's a great dad joke about Donald Trump with exactly 5 sentences:
Donald Trump walked into a library and asked the librarian, "Do you have any books on Pavlov's dogs and Trump's dogs?" The librarian replied, "It rings a bell, but I'm not sure if we have anything on that subject." Trump said, "Fake news! My dog is the greatest!" The librarian responded, "Sir, your dog can't even sit still for a second." Trump grumbled, "Sad!"
