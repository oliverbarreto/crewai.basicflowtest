Poem:
There once was a Donald so fine,
Built a wall that was truly divine.
He tweeted with flair and some skill,
But his ego was always standing still.

Joke:
Donald Trump walked into a library and asked the librarian, "Do you have any books on Pavlov's dogs and Hitler?" The librarian replied, "It rings a bell, but I'm not sure if it's relevant to the current administration." Donald Trump responded, "Fake news!" He then left a review on Yelp saying, "The service was top-notch, but the content was tremendous."
