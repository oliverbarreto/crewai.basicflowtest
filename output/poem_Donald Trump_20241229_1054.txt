Poem:
Here's a funny, light-hearted poem about Donald Trump with exactly 3 sentences:

He tweeted his tweets with a mighty roar,
Built walls to keep out the haters galore,
But his hairdo was something we couldn't ignore.

Joke:
Donald Trump walked into a library and asked the librarian, "Do you have any books on Pavlov's dogs and Trump's dogs?" The librarian replied, "It rings a bell, but I'm not sure if we have anything on that topic." The Trump dog just barked loudly and said, "Fake news!"
